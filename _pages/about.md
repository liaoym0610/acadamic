My name is Yumeng Liao and I'm currently a PhD candidate from the group of Prof. Kyoko Nozaki at The University of Tokyo. My research focuses on the development of homegeneous transition metal catalyst for the selective degradation of thermosetting resins. Before joining the Nozaki group, I conducted my undergraduate research with Prof. Takanori Matsuda at Toyko University of Science, and my master research with Prof. Nobuharu Iwasawa at Tokyo Institute of Technology, where I was working on transition metal catalysis.
