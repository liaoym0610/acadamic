Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Yumeng Liao and I'm currently a PhD candidate from the group of <a href="http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/nozakilab/indexE.html" target="_blank">Prof. Kyoko Nozaki</a> at The University of Tokyo. My research focuses on the development of homegeneous nickel catalyst for the selective degradation of thermosetting resins.<br><br>
Before joining the Nozaki group, I conducted my undergraduate research with <a href="https://www.rs.tus.ac.jp/mtd/" target="_blank">Prof. Takanori Matsuda</a> at Toyko University of Science, and my master research with <a href="http://www.chemistry.titech.ac.jp/~iwasawa/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Nobuharu Iwasawa</a> at Tokyo Institute of Technology, where I was working on rhodium and ruthenium catalysis for Câ€“H activation.<br><br>
I am scheduled to Join <a href="https://roque.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Prof. Jose Roque</a>'s group at Princeton University from May 2025 as a postdoctoral research associate. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via those links in the sidebar!<br><br>
